## Technologies used
- **React (Frontend):** I utilized React for the frontend, leveraging its component-based architecture and state management techniques to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Material UI/CSS (Styling):** I used Material UI, along with CSS, to style and enhance the visual design of the application, ensuring a modern and appealing look and feel.
- **Express (Backend):** I employed Express.js as the web API framework to handle routing and server-side logic, enabling smooth communication between the frontend and backend components.
- **MongoDB / Mongoose (Database)**:** I utilized MongoDB,  in combination with Mongoose, for data storage and management. Mongoose provided a convenient way to define data schemas, model objects, and interact with the MongoDB database. While MongoDB provided a clean and flexible document based database to store my data.
- **Google Maps API:** I utilized the Google Maps API to integrate mapping and geolocation features, enhancing the application with interactive maps, venue markers, and geolocation functionality.
## Unsolved Problems
